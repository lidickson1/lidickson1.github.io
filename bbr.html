            <p class="mt-12 mb-6">A Minecraft server dedicated to provide the most unique and fun
                battle royale experience. Featuring responsive and satisfying
                gunplay, exciting and challenging gamemodes, as well as stylish
                cosmetics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since its release, we have obtained more than 4000 unique player
                logins. Our success has led us to officially acquired by the #1 Minecraft
                gun server - <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400" href="https://guncolony.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gun Colony</a>, which has a total of 200,000 players and over 100,000 hours
                of playtime.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-amber-400 text-neutral-800 rounded-md p-4"><p>On May 22th, 2021, we have officially announced the closure
                    of Bayview Battle Royale. The future of the server is
                    currently in the hands of Gun Colony, and we sincerely hope
                    something good will come out of this in the future. We would
                    also like to thank all of our valuable players for being a
                    part of the BBR community.

<div class="section bg-stone-900"><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-white mb-10" data-aos="fade-down">Battle Royale
    </h1>
    <p class="text-stone-300 mb-8" data-aos="fade-up">Our flagship gamemode — Battle Royale, is the first to bring the
        mainstream game phenomenon of the decade to Minecraft. You drop from the
        plane along with 60 other players, gather loot and gear up while
        constantly keeping track of the shrinking zone. Air drops spawn every 5
        minutes which contain the best loot. Kill or outlast the other players
        and the last man standing wins!
        <br>
        <br>
        We currently have a total of 5 expansive maps that are included in Battle
        Royale, each with its own unique landscape and locations — from the
        snowy tundra of Bavaria, to the dense metropolitan area centered around Stadium.
        The gamemode also has a diverse arsenal of over 20 weapons, and each gun
        uses a different caliber and supports different attachments, adding great
        depth to the gameplay.

<div class="section bg-stone-950"><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-white mb-10" data-aos="fade-down">Bots
    </h1>
    <p class="text-stone-300 mb-8" data-aos="fade-up">I developed/invented the first ever fully autonomous Minecraft FPS bots
        that act like real players. They can acquire targets, intelligently path
        find to various locations and waypoints, and can shoot remarkably well.
        All of the AI code is done from scratch without any external libraries.
        It has also been optimized so that it does not impact server performance
        nor eat up too many resources. The server is still able to run smooth
        even on slow/budget hardware.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having bots in matches meant that players can still have an intense gameplay
        experience even during inactive hours when there are less players online.
        For example, despite the fact that most of the players are from North America,
        European/Asian players are still able to have fun. As a result, we are able
        to obtain a huge increase in player engagement and longer playtime by 300%.

<div class="section bg-stone-900"><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-white mb-10" data-aos="fade-down">Cosmetics
    </h1>
    <div class="mb-8"><p class="text-stone-300 mb-6" data-aos="fade-up">Players can choose to purchase cosmetics (with real money) to
            support the server. Some examples include gun skins, crates,
            wearable items, and more. A fully functional website (link below)
            was implemented that provides a modern and convenient interface for
            players to browse and buy from our store. Players can also easily
            equip and check out their cosmetics with a simple and elegant GUI.
